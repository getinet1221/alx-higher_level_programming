# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions
## Requirements
- Python 3.4
- pep8 1.7
## File Descriptions
### Mandatory
#### [0. Squared simple](https://github.com/getinet1221/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/0-square_matrix_simple.py)
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

- Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
- matrix is a 2 dimensional array
- Returns a new matrix:
	- Same size as matrix
	- Each value should be the square of the value of the input
- Initial matrix should not be modified
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
